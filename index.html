    <!-- categories: note- make these more obscure so users will have a harder time figurind it out. Lifestyle (alchoholic drinks, snack foods, mobility, houses, jobs, degrees, etc), Arts and Culture (songs/bands, TV shows, Films, Pixar Movies),   -->

    <!-- FIRST SECTION- DROP DOWNS, SECOND SECTION-RADIO BOC, THIRD SECTION CHECKBOXES,  -->

<!-- what it will do- assign #values to each response, add these values from each section, calculate a total score 100/150 punk points and a sinpatico score (convert punk points to a percentage. Eventually, could be someething that navigates between two pages for multiple users so they could compare their responses rather than just compare with my thing.) -->
